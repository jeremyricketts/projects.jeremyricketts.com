# 2sv-prototype

A prototype project for exploring new features within Planning Center.

## Author

## Purpose

This project serves as a testing ground for prototyping new features and functionality that may be integrated into Planning Center in the future.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   Note: Usually you'd use `npm run build` but I needed some custom config in Vite to get it to run in a subdomain
