# 2SV Prototype - Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a React-based prototype for Planning Center, designed to demonstrate a new Two-Step Verification (2SV) requirement feature for organization administrators. The prototype mimics Planning Center's design system and user interface patterns.

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Headless UI (for dropdown components)
- Heroicons (for icons)

## What We Built

### 1. Planning Center UI Template
Created a faithful recreation of Planning Center's admin interface including:
- Header with navigation tabs and user menu
- Sidebar navigation for People section
- Administrator table showing users and their 2SV status
- Footer with organization/user information
- Planning Center's color scheme and typography

### 2. Two-Step Verification Requirement Feature
Developed a comprehensive security feature that allows system administrators to require 2SV for all organization administrators:

#### Core Functionality
- **Status Display**: Prominent colored badges showing if the requirement is Disabled (yellow), Enabled (green), or Scheduled (blue)
- **Two Enforcement Methods**:
  - Immediate enforcement with warning about users being logged out
  - Scheduled enforcement for a future date to give users time to comply

#### User Communication
- **Email Notification System**: 
  - Customizable email templates for both enforcement types
  - Template variables for personalization ({first_name}, {last_name}, {enforcement_date})
  - Subject line customization
  - Optional email sending (checkbox for immediate enforcement)

#### UI/UX Improvements
- Combined multiple dialogs into streamlined single-step processes
- Dropdown menu for enforcement options showing affected user counts
- Clear visual hierarchy with warning messages and status indicators
- Progressive disclosure (email fields only shown when needed)

## Key Milestones

1. **Initial Template Setup**: Built the Planning Center-style interface with proper layout and components
2. **Feature Implementation**: Added the core 2SV requirement functionality with enable/disable controls
3. **Enforcement Options**: Implemented both immediate and scheduled enforcement workflows
4. **Email System**: Added comprehensive email notification capabilities with templates
5. **UI Refinement**: Streamlined the user experience by combining dialogs and improving visual feedback
6. **Template Variables**: Added email personalization with template variables

## Current State
The prototype successfully demonstrates how a 2SV requirement feature could work within Planning Center's existing interface. It shows:
- How administrators would enable/configure the requirement
- The communication flow to affected users
- Clear status indicators and warnings
- A polished, production-ready user experience

The feature is designed to protect churches from data breaches by ensuring all administrators use two-step verification for their accounts.
